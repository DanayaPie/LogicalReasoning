**Problem:**

You are standing in a room with three light switches. The switches all correspond to three different light bulbs in an adjacent room that you cannot see into. With all the light switches starting in the off position, how can you find out which switch connects to which light bulb?

**Answer:**

Turn on 2 or 3 switches, wait for a minute, and then turn off 1 of the on-switch. Enter the room; if the light bulb is on, the on-switch connects to the light bulb. Touch the light bulb, and if the bulb is warm, the switch that was turned on then turned off connects to the light bulb. If the light bulb is cold, the switch that stays off connects to the light bulb.
